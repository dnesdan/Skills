# Evaluation Rubric

Judge the concept against the frozen brief, not against novelty. Use `Pass`,
`Concern`, or `Fail` with one sentence of evidence for each relevant category.

## Hard failures

A direction cannot win when it:

- invents a capability, data source, derived fact, navigation destination,
  visible control, or interactive affordance
- removes or obscures essential product content or the primary action
- depends on unreadable generated text to explain the design
- violates safe areas, clips essential content, or uses impossible geometry
- requires shipping the generated bitmap as interactive UI
- conflicts with the native platform's navigation or accessibility model
- cannot adapt to required devices, large text, or localization
- copies distinctive third-party branding or artwork

Back arrows, hamburger menus, overflow icons, chevrons, tabs, filters, badges,
row actions, and floating controls count as interactive affordances even when
they are conventional platform symbols. Fail them unless source evidence or the
user's brief explicitly allows them.

## Product fit

- Does the hierarchy serve the primary user job?
- Is the next action clear without explanatory decoration?
- Does disclosure match task frequency, urgency, and risk?
- Does the concept preserve real product states and constraints?

## Native platform fit

- Could this be expressed with semantic SwiftUI or Compose structure?
- Are navigation, presentation, back behavior, controls, and input cues native?
- Are system materials and effects used for function rather than costume?
- Does the design avoid browser patterns and static mockup tricks?

## Visual craft

- Is alignment intentional and spacing rhythm coherent?
- Are type roles distinct without oversized marketing hierarchy?
- Are grouping and depth understandable without excessive containers?
- Is contrast adequate and color semantic?
- Does content remain primary?

## Accessibility and adaptation

- Can controls meet platform target-size expectations?
- Can text scale, wrap, and localize without destroying hierarchy?
- Is essential state conveyed without relying only on color, motion, glass,
  haptics, or a shader?
- Can the layout work in required window sizes, orientations, and input modes?

## AI-slop rejection

Treat these as concerns when decorative, repetitive, or unrelated to the
product:

- purple-blue gradients, aurora blobs, neon glow, sparkles, and fake AI marks
- nested rounded cards or pills around routine content
- arbitrary floating controls and oversized empty space
- glass applied to content rather than a functional control layer
- decorative charts, badges, avatars, or metrics unsupported by real data
- uniform "premium" shadows, blur, and highlights with no depth model
- verbose aspirational copy replacing clear product language

Do not reject an effect merely because it is common. Name the product or
usability harm.

## Feasibility and risk

Identify:

- reusable project components versus necessary new primitives
- state, navigation, data, and localization changes implied
- availability gates and fallbacks
- likely layout, rendering, shader, battery, or performance risk
- whether the direction is a focused change or an architecture rewrite

## Still-image limitation

Do not score animation smoothness, gesture quality, haptics, focus continuity,
screen-reader order, state restoration, or runtime performance from a still.
